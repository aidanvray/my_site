         While working on both sites for this assignment I noticed some pretty drastic differences between using PSU sites and building a site using html. 
         Coding with html and css felt like a sandbox, where pretty much any feat in web design could be achieved with enough effort. 
         The basics of coding in html are fairly easy to pick up, and the oxygen editor was helpful with its error detection and autofill options. 
         Where things start to get a bit more complicated is in the css styling. 
         With it you can basically customize anything within your html code. 
         However, this is where things can also get a bit confusing. 
         I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the variety of different options and multiple approaches that could be taken to styling something the same way. 
         But with more practice, I feel I could get a much better handle on css styling.
         In stark contrast, using PSU pages felt like a convenient but limited tool for easily assembling a blog or something similar. 
         The editor's compatibility with html was fairly intuitive, but didn't really feel necessary to use. 
         It was useful for copying the code I used on my GitHub pages site, but it's not something I would use if I was working exclusively with PSU pages. 
         My overall impression of PSU pages was that it's really easy set up a site, dump in some content, organize it, and slap on a decent theme to make it look nice. 
         This is good, but trying to do too much outside of the service's scope seemed like it would require a disproportional amount of work that would be better spent using something that's less restrictive.
