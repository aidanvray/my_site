            The final project in my Game 220 class was a group project where we had to create a design document for a game, and then pitch it to the rest of the class. 
            I worked with Jacob Osullivan, Mason Elliott, Alex Anderson, Huy Tran, and Joshua Partridge to create Cyberhook. Cyberhook is a platform fighting game with mechanics similar to Super Smash Bros., with the addition of a grappling hook.
            The grappling is used both as a mobility option, and a way to attack enemies from afar. Cyberhook takes place in a cyberpunk future where there is a great divide between people with cybernetic enhancements and ordinary people. 
            The story is framed around a world martial arts tournament where people are free to enter regardless of their background. I was responsible for designing the playable roster of competitors in Cyberhook. I ended up creating 10 characters to be included in the base game. 
            Below I detail the background, playstyle, strengths, and weaknesses of each of these 10 characters.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h3>Kuno</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Kuno is one of the last in her clan of ninja, with it appearing as though there’s no place for her kind in the modern world. She hopes that a tournament victory will be to save her clan and show the world that success is possible without relying on modern technology.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: A well rounded character with a little bit of everything in her toolkit. From the air she’s able to throw shuriken and use a glider to increase her airtime. On the ground she is lethal up close with her ninjato (Japanese shortsword).</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Kuno’s main strength and her greatest weakness is her versatility. She has good mobility, offence, projectiles, etc. but will always lose out in any given area to a character more specialized for the task.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Model α</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Model α is the first of its kind, a fully functional autonomous robot fighter. The machine houses a highly advanced AI and a wide arsenal of weaponry. It’s entrance in this tournament is little more than its creators’ free tech demo.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Model α is a high mobility zoner. It uses thrusters while grappling to quickly move around the screen. Model α focuses on long range combat by firing its arsenal of rockets and lasers.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Model α is easily the most powerful zoner in the game. The mix of strong projectiles and mobility makes it easy to run away and pepper the stage with artillery. To compensate Model α has little it can do to fight back against the opponent once the distance is closed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Captain Lawrence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Captain Lawrence is the proud owner of his own ship where he makes a living off of fishing and salvaging sunken treasure/technology. He’s entering the tournament for the prize money, so he can expand his simple ship into an entire fleet at his command.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Lawrence is a bit of an oddball, with a playstyle centered around random items. He uses his favorite fishing rod both as a grappling hook and a way to “fish” random items onto the stage.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Lawrence is often at the mercy of his luck with items, and requires a good bit of set up to be strong. But under the right conditions the captain can be a truly formidable foe.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Dr. Sandman</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: A mysterious inventor only known by his alias, Dr. Sandman competes to show the power of his tech. Sporting his signature terrain generation apparatus, the doctor is able mold the battlefield to his own liking.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Strong midrange fighter with some good utility. His apparatus lets him create sand structures that either player can grapple onto. He also uses sand to attack foes from a distance with his normal attacks and sand tornado projectile.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: When he’s in the midrange, Dr. Sandman’s far reaching attacks and mobility options are excellent at maintaining that space and keeping opponents out. However, once an opponent closes the gap, he has few reliable options.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Aaron</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Aaron was once an assistant in Vlad’s lab. But when the shock from an experiment paralyzed his right arm, there was no choice but to replace it with a mechanical prosthetic. Ever since then Aaron has been preparing for vengeance.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Aaron is the archetypal grappler of CyberHook. He wants to get up close and force opponents to deal with his unblockable command grabs. His main two are his standard and anti-air command grabs. And since his grappling hook is his mechanical arm, he can also grab people with it.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: To make up for his ability to grab people from a distance, Aaron’s grappling hook travels slower than most other characters. This also limits his mobility and can make it difficult to get in on opponents. But when Aaron is able to close the gap he is one of the most frightening characters to face up close.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Sheldon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Before the Bureau of Cybernetics Regulation was established, there was little in place to check the ethics of experimentation with the emerging technology. So there was no one to stop scientists from turning a simple turtle into a soldier capable of great destruction. With his tragic past behind him Sheldon enters the tournament as the only animal competitor.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Sheldon is a strong defensive character. As a turtle his shell is his greatest strength, with a grappling hook and mortar mounted on it. He also takes reduced chip damage while blocking and can perform a shell spin as a reversal option.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Sheldon has the strongest defense in the game, but most of his strongest options require him to be on the ground. His defensive nature can also make comebacks hard whenever he is too far behind.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Kenji</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Early on in his kickboxing career Kenji quickly realized the limits his human physiology could achieve. It was then that he decided to replace his legs with machinery. Now Kenji has entered the tournament to push the limits of his strength and show flawless martial prowess working in harmony with cutting edge technology.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Shoto (same archetype as ryu, ken, gran, ragna, sol, etc.). Kenji has a lot of the standard tools befitting of his archetype including a reversal rising kick and a roundhouse kick that creates a fireball. He can also use a fast divekick while in the air.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Kenji is a solid character that’s easy for inexperienced players to pick up, while still being strong enough to be viable at higher levels of play. However, Kenji will always suffer from being a relatively simple character in comparison to the rest of the cast.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Henry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: Background: A young mechanic piloting their own custom mech.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Henry’s mech is the largest character in the game. His game plan is to pummel opponents up close with his mech’s overwhelming strength. Many of his attacks are hard to interrupt due to their armor, and dangerous to block because of their higher chip damage.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Henry probably has the most extreme set of strengths and weaknesses. His mech has the lowest mobility of any character in the game. That paired with its size can make it an easy target. To make up for this Henry has high durability and damage.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Agent Irina</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: As an agent for the Bureau of Cybernetics Regulation, she is responsible for hunting down those that create or possess illegal modifications. Irina has entered the tournament to remind all of the bureau’s power and under the suspicion of another competitor using some forbidden technology.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: Utilizes projectiles and grappling to enable oppressive offence. She uses two handguns, one fires her grappling hook and the other fire smart bullets. These bullets can be angled when fired and will ricochet multiple times off any surface. Irina also has more options than most other characters when opponents block her grappling hook.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: When Irina is able to distract the opponent by covering the screen in bouncing smart bullets, she can easily get in and run her offense. But her smart bullets are weaker than many other projectiles in the game.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Vlad</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: A radical purist set on bringing about the end of all cyborgs. He entered this tournament to use it as a testing ground for his newest gadget.</li>
            <li>Playstyle: A high risk high reward character that uses electrical attacks cash out on big damage. His electricity can shock opponents to either start or further extend combos. This leads to high combo damage and the ability to turn just about any stray hit into a decent combo.</li>
            <li>Strengths and weaknesses: Vlad doesn’t have many strengths outside of his high damage.  His strongest attacks are also very risky and can be punished if they are whiffed or blocked.</li>
        </ul>
